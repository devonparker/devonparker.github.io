<!-- General Introduction -->
    <div class="aboutme">
      <p> My name is Devon Parker, and I am a current sophomore at Dartmouth College
        majoring in Computer Science. I grew up in a small town called Weston, located
        just 15 minutes outside of Boston. I love doing outdoor activities, including
        skiing, snowboarding, hiking, ice skating, swimming, and canoeing. I initially
        entered Dartmouth with the intention of being pre-med, but after taking CS1 and
        CS10, I realized I really enjoyed Computer Science and decided to switch my major.

<!-- Computer Science focused introduction -->
      <p> The think that I like the most about computer programming is the process of building
        something from scratch that eventually functions to serve a purpose. Additionally,
        learning in computer science classes feels like I am expanding my real-world skills. The things
        I learn in class enable me to build an unlimited range of things. Lastly, something
        I really love about coding is the methodical way of thinking that my brain follows in order
        to solve problems. If given the opportunity to work at DALI in the Fall, I would be thrilled
        to use the tools I learn in my classes to work on projects with real-world benefits and purposes.
        Although I am lacking experience in many upper-level courses, I am extremely passionate about
        programming and am excited by the idea of working and learning at DALI lab.
